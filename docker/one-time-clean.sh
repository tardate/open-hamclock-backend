# These are files that should be cleaned only one time. The docker volume container persists
# files basically forever. We need a maintenance mechanism. Possible uses are:
#   - old files that are no longer used
#   - cache or data files that need to be cleared out once upon upgrade, usually for fixing a bug
#
# After the files list is run, it is cleared out so that it doesn't run again. This is especially 
# required for clearing data on upgrade. We don't want to clear the data on every restart, just
# one time.
#
# The files are relative to a root of /opt/hamclock-backend/htdocs/state/ which is the docker-mounted volume
