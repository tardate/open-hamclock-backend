## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install in a container with Docker
Download the manager utility that masks all the Docker details. Visit the releases page:

👉 [Releases](https://github.com/BrianWilkinsFL/open-hamclock-backend/releases)
and download the asset: **Manage Docker installs**.

Make it executable:
```
chmod +x manage-ohb-docker.sh
```

Run it. Substitute the version you want. This installs v0.16:
```
.\manage-ohb-docker.sh install -t 0.16
```
