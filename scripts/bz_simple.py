#  Build Bz.txt from NOAA SWPC rtsw_mag_1m.json.
#
#  Upstream (new):
#    https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/rtsw/rtsw_mag_1m.json
#
#  Replaces (deprecated):
#    https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-wind/mag-3-day.json
#
#  Output:
#    # UNIX        Bx     By     Bz     Bt
#    <epoch> <bx_gsm> <by_gsm> <bz_gsm> <bt>
#
#  Target path:
#    /opt/hamclock-backend/htdocs/ham/HamClock/Bz/Bz.txt
#
#  Data notes:
#    - The new feed is an array of objects (not header-row + data-rows).
#    - Each timestamp appears twice: once for DSCOVR and once for ACE.
#      Only the record with "active": true is the authoritative source.
#    - Field names: bx_gsm, by_gsm, bz_gsm, bt (bt is unchanged).
#    - Records arrive newest-first; we sort ascending before binning.
#    - If the feed covers less than 25h, leading bins are padded with
#      the oldest available sample so HamClock always gets BZBT_NV rows.
